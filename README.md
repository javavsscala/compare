Compare Java versus Scala side by side

The goal is to learn and share a new feature of Scala on a daily basis, collect feedback and improve. 
So definitely send in your suggestions, fixes and improvements.
All examples and explanations assume that the programmer has proficiency in Java and is exploring 
Scala.  

The focus here is on bottom up learning- examples leading to generalization. The second principle
applied  here is that it is easier to learn a new concept doing a compare and contrast with a familiar concept.
